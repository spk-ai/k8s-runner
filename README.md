# k8s-runner

k8s-runner is the Kubernetes-native implementation of the RunnerService gRPC API.

Architecture: [k8s-runner](https://github.com/agynio/architecture/blob/main/architecture/k8s-runner.md)

## Control Transport

With `ZITI_ENABLED=true`, the full RunnerService is served only on the OpenZiti
listener. The plaintext `GRPC_ADDR` listener accepts only the exact unary
`RunnerService.Ready` RPC; other unary methods and all streams return
`Unauthenticated`. Request headers cannot opt into control access. Existing
TCP health probes still connect, but neither TCP connectivity nor `Ready`
proves successful enrollment or an available overlay terminator.

Previously both listeners shared a full gRPC server, so a client that could
reach the TCP port could bypass the overlay's service-access policy. Network
policies may restrict that reachability; this is an application-level closure,
not a claim that every deployed workload could reach the port. OpenZiti's
[Dial and Bind policies](https://netfoundry.io/docs/openziti/learn/core-concepts/security/authorization/policies/overview/)
remain responsible for who may access and provide the overlay service.

Clients using raw TCP for control while the runner has Ziti enabled must move
to the overlay before rollout. Disabling Ziti is not a secure workaround.
`ZITI_ENABLED=false` retains the existing standalone plaintext API for trusted
development or independently protected deployments; this patch does not make
that mode suitable for untrusted agents. Production must enforce the intended
transport profile and audit overlay policies and all callers.

Listener separation applies before enrollment starts. Failed startup stops both
servers, without leaving a plaintext fallback. There is no new API, credential
format, deployment flag, runtime prompt or workflow dependency.

Verification uses real loopback gRPC connections and a child process running the
production startup path. It covers every generated unary/streaming RPC,
forged metadata, similarly named/future service methods, control and standalone
success, pending/failed enrollment and observed listener closure. The startup
fixture replaces only the Kubernetes client constructor and uses a blocked
loopback Gateway stub; it inherits no host, cluster or provider credentials.
It performs no real Kubernetes operations, enrollment, model calls or deployment
changes. Full `go test -race ./...` passes 152 tests including subtests; the child
entry point runs only when launched by its parent test. Build and vet also pass.

This is not an audit of live Dial/Bind policies, real overlay reconnection or
revocation, per-owner authorization, runner/backend incarnation binding,
late-operation/node fencing, or a coordinated deployed A2A acceptance. Those
remain separate requirements; neither this health endpoint nor overlay
connectivity is proof of the expected storage backend.

## Local Development

Full setup: [Local Development](https://github.com/agynio/architecture/blob/main/architecture/operations/local-development.md)

### Prepare environment

```bash
git clone https://github.com/agynio/bootstrap.git
cd bootstrap
chmod +x apply.sh
./apply.sh -y
```

See [bootstrap](https://github.com/agynio/bootstrap) for details.

### Run from sources

```bash
# Deploy once (exit when healthy)
devspace dev

# Watch mode (streams logs, re-syncs on changes)
devspace dev -w
```

### E2E tests

E2E coverage runs from the centralized suite in
[`agynio/e2e`](https://github.com/agynio/e2e) using the `k8s_runner` service tag.
See [E2E Testing](https://github.com/agynio/architecture/blob/main/architecture/operations/e2e-testing.md).

## Docker capability notes

The `docker` capability injects a Docker sidecar. For the **rootless**
implementation, the sidecar runs nested `runc` and requires additional
permissions and mounts to allow `docker run` to work:

- `allowPrivilegeEscalation: true` for rootlesskit/newuidmap.
- `seccompProfile: Unconfined` and `appArmorProfile: Unconfined` because
  default RuntimeDefault/AppArmor profiles block mount-related syscalls
  (for example mounting `/proc`) required by nested `runc`.
- `procMount: Unmasked` to avoid `/proc` mount masking interfering with
  nested `runc` container setup.
- `pod.spec.hostUsers: false` with an init container that writes
  `/etc/subuid` and `/etc/subgid` entries inside the pod user namespace.
- HostPath mount for `/dev/net/tun` (type `CharDevice`).
- `docker-data` emptyDir mounted at `/home/rootless/.local/share` so dockerd
  can create its own `docker/` data root with correct ownership.

These settings can require Pod Security Admission exceptions for docker-capable
workloads (baseline/restricted clusters may reject them).

### Kata (microVM) docker runtimes

`CAPABILITY_IMPLEMENTATIONS` also supports `docker: kata-qemu` (and optionally
`docker: kata-fc`). When enabled, k8s-runner keeps the privileged DinD sidecar
behavior but sets `pod.spec.runtimeClassName` to match the selected Kata
implementation. The cluster must provide the matching RuntimeClass and schedule
onto KVM-capable nodes. This cannot be validated on local k3d/mac setups.

## Workload egress NetworkPolicy

The Helm chart can install the static egress NetworkPolicy used by egress v1.
Enable `workloadEgressNetworkPolicy.enabled` and set `workloadNamespace` to the
namespace where runner-created workload pods run. The policy selects workload
pods with `agyn.dev/managed-by=agents-orchestrator`, allows OpenZiti synthetic
addresses (`100.64.0.0/10`), cluster DNS, and public internet, and excludes
`workloadEgressNetworkPolicy.clusterPodCIDR`,
`workloadEgressNetworkPolicy.clusterServiceCIDR`, and
`workloadEgressNetworkPolicy.additionalInternalCIDRs` from public internet
egress. `blockedCIDRs` remains as a deprecated compatibility alias.

Ziti underlay egress is configured with first-class chart values. Enable
`zitiWorkloadDNS` to allow workload pods to reach the Ziti workload DNS pods on
TCP/UDP 53. Configure `zitiUnderlay.endpoints` for the enrollment controller,
runtime Istio ingress gateway, and router underlay endpoints returned by
`ziti-workload-dns`. Each endpoint can allow a concrete service ClusterIP `/32`,
endpoint/backend pod CIDRs through `backendCIDRs`, a namespace/pod selector,
or a combination. Runtime `ziti.<base-domain>:443` resolves to
the Istio ingress gateway so TLS passthrough can route SNI to the controller
client service. This keeps `.agyn` application traffic on the overlay while
allowing only the underlay endpoints required for sidecar startup:

```yaml
workloadEgressNetworkPolicy:
  zitiWorkloadDNS:
    enabled: true
  zitiUnderlay:
    endpoints:
      - name: controller
        cidr: "10.43.245.186/32"
        port: 2496
      - name: ingress-gateway
        cidr: "10.43.245.188/32"
        backendCIDRs:
          - "10.42.2.4/32"
        namespaceSelector:
          kubernetes.io/metadata.name: istio-system
        podSelector:
          istio: ingressgateway
        port: 443
      - name: router
        cidr: "10.43.245.187/32"
        port: 2496
```

Bootstrap should derive the underlay endpoint CIDRs from the live
`ziti-controller-client`, `istio-ingressgateway`, and `ziti-router-edge`
ClusterIPs. For the runtime ingress gateway endpoint, bootstrap should also
set endpoint pod CIDRs and the Istio ingress gateway namespace/pod selectors
when available so CNIs can follow endpoint pods instead of only the Service
ClusterIP. Set the controller and router ports to the configured
OpenZiti underlay port, and set the runtime ingress gateway port to `443`.
The deprecated `zitiControllerEnrollment` and `zitiRuntimeIngressGateway` values
remain as named compatibility helpers for deployments that prefer fixed keys.
`zitiRuntimeIngressGateway` accepts the same runtime backend CIDR and selector
fields as `zitiUnderlay.endpoints`, but new bootstrap config should use
`zitiUnderlay.endpoints` for the complete endpoint set.

The runner runtime does not create or update NetworkPolicy resources, and its
ServiceAccount does not need `networkpolicies` RBAC.
